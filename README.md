# snow2d ❄️

`snow2d` is a 2D framework built on top of `rokol`.

It’s a 2D framework specific for my roguelike game. Probably **it doesn’t meet others’ needs**.

## Status

* It needs to be refactored a lot.
* It only works on macOS (TODO: buy Windows and fix [rokol](https://github.com/toyboot4e/rokol)).
