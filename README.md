# snow2d ❄️

`snow2d` is a 2D framework built on top of `rokol`.

`snow2d` is just for my roguelike game; **it doesn’t meet others’ needs**. You can find video clips on [Youtube](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCqNzSW4mFdpaRFPlU-J4_zA/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D).

## Status

* It needs to be refactored a lot.
* It only works on macOS (TODO: buy Windows and fix [rokol](https://github.com/toyboot4e/rokol)).
